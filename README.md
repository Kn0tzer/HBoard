# HBoard

A web based iOS jailbreak alternative, providing tweak injection to a recreation of the iOS homescreen in HTML

## Already Added:

Last updated Jan/13/2025

Almost complete recreation of the iOS homescreen in HTML with (near) pixel perfect accuracy. (Not including the app library)

Semi-automatic homescreen recreation

Spotlight search workaround

Opening apps

## Definitely Happening:

A recreation of the iOS homescreen in HTML

**Tweak injection by adding JavaScript plugins from a repo - think Live Wallpaper, Themes, Always on Display - unlimited possibilities, similar to a jailbreak.**

No sideloading required

Semi-automatic homescreen recreation

Automatically go back to HBoard when closing an app

Spotlight search support (Will be a bit weird)

120hz support

Open source obviously

## Maybe happening:

(Depends on community interest, my motivation, and outside help)

Built in remote control support [(](https://github.com/Kn0tzer/Remote-Control-iPhone)https://github.com/Kn0tzer/Remote-Control-iPhone[)](https://github.com/Kn0tzer/Remote-Control-iPhone)

Basic widgets (xenhtml might be able to help with some things)

Dark mode app icon support (Not sure how to do this automatically - if you have any ideas please tell me)

App Library support (Annoying asf to code)

## Definitely not happening + downsides:

Sideloaded apps, webapps, and apps downloaded after initial setup need to be manually added to HBoard's homescreen

Slight delay (~0.5 seconds) after closing apps to going back to HBoard (This may be a deal breaker for a lot of people.)

No support for notification badges

Advanced widgets (xenhtml might be able to help with some things)

Lock screen or control center recreation - See Prism for the lockscreen - iOS 18 does most control center stuff.
